\title{Run a filter on the data to smooth it out.}
\usage{
filter_data(
  data,
  pupil,
  filter = c("median", "hanning", "lowpass"),
  degree = 11
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a PupillometrySENDA dataframe}

\item{pupil}{column name for pupil data}

\item{filter}{option for filtering the data}

\item{degree}{filter degree}
}
\value{
filtered pupil data
}
\description{
filter_data allows three different options for filtering, a butterworth lowpass filter, a hanning filter, or
a median filter. You can also set the degree of this filter; we recommend a default of 11.
This filters on one pupil, it can be re-run on a second pupil if needed. Lowpass makes use of the
butterworth filter and filtfilt from package signal, median makes use of runmed.
